The Goal of the project was to fetch some data from NASA'S end point as described in the test. The UI can be significantly imporved but did not concentrate too much on it as it was mentioned to concentrate on the functional parts. Apart from that, although this project can be done in a simple way, I wanted to showcase my usual React, Redux and Redux Saga work flows and hence implemented those step by step(Git history would explain it great). Coming to the tests, I have added just one test for now, will add more soon.

To start the Project   
----------> git clone https://github.com/PrakashKoneru/NASA.git  
----------> yarn  
----------> yarn start  
  
To run the tests  
----------> yarn run test
